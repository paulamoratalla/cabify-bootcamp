# Exercise 3 solution

## Getting started

We are now adding a persistence layer, in our case MongoDB.

Al the source code can be found under `/src` folder with models controllers and database connection

To check results we can run:

1) run messageapp with `npm run docker` on port 3000
2) run a local app with `npm run app` on port 9001
3) or run both servers in one command `npm run start:all`

You can run `./curl_requests.sh` to run some curl into the app and see results.
